# UFOs

#### JS, HTML, CSS -- VS Code

##Analysis

In this project I was able to create a search filter for a given dataset( UFO sightings) and I made it so a user can apply multiple
filters to narrow down their searches. My filter makes it so when an input box has text entered into it, the data is filtered based on
that given column and returns all rows with a match. Now if you enter multiple filters it narrows the dataset even further to a more
specific point. I see this as a greater benefit over the for each loop which would have compiled each individual search and stacked it on
top of one another leaving the user with mis matched data. I recommend for further development another form to insert sightings into 
the array, to have even more search results.  This project was completed using languages like Javascript, html, and css and built on 
VS Code.
